# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio
In this Challenge I developed a Portfolio using HTML, and advanced CSS techniques.  I developed the portfolio
to have mobile responsiveness to be viewed on different sized screens. I currently do not have any work samples 
so I made place holders until I develop my projects at a later date.
